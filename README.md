# Buildbackbetter
My dissertation is partnered with [BarbourABI](https://www.barbour-abi.com/) and focuses on measuring the spatial impact of infrastructure on society and how that can be used to ensure Britain builds back better. The following data has been considered to measure societal effects:
- [IMD](https://dclgapps.communities.gov.uk/imd/iod_index.html) [2015](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2015) and [2019](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019)
- [GVA(Â£)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossvalueaddedgva/datasets/regionalgrossvalueaddedbalancedbylocalauthorityintheuk)
- [AHAH](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/access-healthy-assets-hazards-ahah)
- [Wider Determinants of Health](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/wider-determinants/supporting-information/built-and-natural-environment)

Historical infrastructure data and the construction pipeline has been provided by [BarbourABI](https://www.barbour-abi.com/).
